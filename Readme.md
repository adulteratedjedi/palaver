A chat application - It seems for node.js a chat application is the new Hello World This is my attempt to learn the language

## Goals
As I have said the main goal of this application is purely to learn ry/node however the goals for the chat application are:

  * Group chat, with seperate rooms
  * 1-1 messaging between users
  * fully searchable chat history
  * filesharing - uploaded by dragging into the window with a live preview of images/pdfs
  * inline gists
  * To have a decent API, allowing support tickets, git commits, and the like to be announced to the room

The messages will be stored in mongodb, LearnBoost/mongoose seems like a good way for interfacing with it.
